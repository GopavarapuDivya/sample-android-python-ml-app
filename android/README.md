#Loan Prediction System
##Introduction
This project predicts if the applicant is eligible to avail loan or not by considering the applicant details.It is done by using various machine learning algorithms.

##Algorithm used
Some of the machine learning algorithms are applied and choosen the algorithm that gives highest accuracy.For this project the algorithm used is **Random Forest Classifier**

##Working of Algorithm

1.At first,consider the dataset and preprocess the data.
2.Now,split the data into two terms train data and test data.
3.Build Random Forest Classifier Model.
4.After that the model which is built is trained with the **train data** and it is tested with **test data**.
5.Test data doesnot contain class label and at last the model gives the accuracy.
